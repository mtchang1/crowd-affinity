    <p>Hi! You're helping a designer by contributing questions and answers that related to a given topic. To accomplish the task, you need to complete 5 small tasks, which can be about answering a question, raing others' answers and coming up with a new question. NOTE: the quality of your answers and questions will influence the payment you receive, so please choose "I don't know" to skip to the next question if you're not familiar with this particular topic. </p>
